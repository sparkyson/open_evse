       * The straightforward formula to compute 'milliwatt-seconds' would be:
       *     mws = (mv/1000) * (ma/1000) * dms;
       *
       * However, this has some serious drawbacks, namely, truncating values
       * when using integer math. This can introduce a lot of error!
       *     5900 milliamps -> 5.9 amps (float) -> 5 amps (integer)
       *     0.9 amps difference / 5.9 amps -> 15.2% error
       *
       * The crazy equation below helps ensure our intermediate results always
       * fit in a 32-bit unsigned integer, but retain as much precision as
       * possible throughout the calculation. Here is how it was derived:
       *     mws = (mv/1000) * (ma/1000) * dms;
       *     mws = (mv/(2**3 * 5**3)) * (ma/(2**3 * 5**3)) * dms;
       *     mws = (mv/2**3) * (ma/(2**3) / 5**6 * dms;
       *     mws = (mv/2**4) * (ma/(2**2) / 5**6 * dms;
       *
       * By breaking 1000 into prime factors of 2 and 5, and shifting things
       * around, we almost match the precision of floating-point math.
       *
       * Using 16 and 4 divisors, rather than 8 and 8, helps precision because
       * mv is always greater than ~100000, but ma can be as low as ~6000.
       *
       * A final note- the divisions by factors of 2 are done with right shifts
       * by the compiler, so the revised equation, although it looks quite
       * complex, only requires one divide operation.
